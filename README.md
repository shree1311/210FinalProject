# Predicting Energy Usage and Carbon Emissions

This project aims to predict the share of coal, gas and renewables in eneregy generation by country. It takes into account GDP, population and current emissions to make these predictions for the year 2050. 

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle:
[World Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Prediction Notebook

Open and execute the `energy_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.
